# Hack-a-thing-1 

## What I Attempted:
I found a tutorial by React for creating an interactive tic-tac-toe board, using JavaScript, and some css/html frameworks. Using the tutorial, I set up my local machine to use a localhost and had to determine how to use other file paths on a local platform. I could have done the tutorial on the web, but I wanted to set up React on my local machine in the event that I wanted to develop webapps in the future. 

**I worked by myself**


## What I Learned:
Previously, I had no experience with JavaScript, css, or html. I spent a large portion of time (~2hrs) reviewing the syntax and the basics of the languages. I also learned how to set up localhost on my machine using Apache (MacOS), and how to configure `.conf` files . Initially, I had quite a few problems with setting up the localhost on my laptop, and I ended up spending a lot of time (~4hrs) becoming familiar with how localhosts can be set up and learned what `.conf` files are and how they work. 
I learned a lot about React, the data structures used and I learned the basics of coding in JavaScript. 

## What Didn't Work:
Ultimately the game worked, but I ended up debugging some things as I tried to avoid just copying code verbatim from the tutorial. Instead, I tried to determine how to get each functionality independently first, then looking at the other code if I got stuck. 

### Tutorials Followed:
**Interactive game**: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

**Setting up Localhost**: https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-13841 
(I found this "tutorial" after struggling to get localhost to work for quite some time.  It didn't completely solve my problems, but it was helpful.  Turns out my `.conf`  had some errors and I had to go through and find the errors and figure out how to set up the host for differing file locations.)
